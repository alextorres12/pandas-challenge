## PyCity Schools
This script will take two different CSVs of school district data (one for school-level data and another for student-level data) and perform various analyses to summarize, organize, and highlight trends in the data. The script is broken up into the following 8 major sections in order to reveal test scores, budgets, school types, and school sizes:

- District Level Summary
- School Level Summary
- Top 5 Performing Schools by % Overall Passing test scores
- Bottom 5 Performing Schools by % Overall Passing test scores
- School Math Scores by Grade
- School Reading Scores by Grade
- Test Scores by School Size
- Test Scores by School Type

## Observable Trends
1. Charter schools tend to perform better than District schools. When grouping by school type, Charter schools reflect a much higher percentage of students that pass both Math and Reading tests. 
2. Within each school, test scores remain very consistent from grade to grade. Test score variance is much more likely to occur at a school-to-school level rather than changing from grade to grade. It would be interesting to see how individual students perform over the course of their high school careers to further analyze this trend.
